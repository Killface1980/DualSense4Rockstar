ScriptHook installation. Follow the guide, same goes for ScriptHookDotNet

- Download and install Script Hook RDR2 http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/
- You'll also need a version of ScriptHookRDR2DotNet (SHRDN). In case you don't know what that is or you have no other mods installed prior, pick https://github.com/Halen84/ScriptHookRDR2DotNet-V2/releases and extract the contents of the zip in your RDR2 main directory.
- In case you have mods depending on v1 of SHRDN, be sure to get the latest version here https://github.com/saltyq/scripthookrdr2dotnet/releases -- V1 of this mod is only updated occasionally and V2 is the preferred option.
- Create a folder called "Scripts" (if not already existing) inside RDR2
Go to https://github.com/Killface1980/DualSense4Rockstar/tree/master/__RELEASE
Download all files inside "RDR2" or "RDR2 ScriptHook v1" -- "RDR2" refers to the current ScriptHookDotNet version 2. Chose the folder according to the SHRDN version earlier.
Put the files in your "Scripts" folder.
